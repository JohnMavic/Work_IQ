## v2.0.0 — February 27, 2026

**Three-Phase Scan Pipeline — Complete Rewrite**

The scan system was rebuilt from a monolithic single-pass scan into a three-phase pipeline:

### Phase 1: Discovery
- New `SCAN_DISCOVERY_SKILL.md` — lightweight subject/sender/date extraction only
- Deduplication context: sends top 50 active + 30 done tasks to AI to prevent duplicates
- Actions: `new` (create task), `update` (modify existing), `skip` (already done)

### Phase 2: Enrichment
- New `ENRICH_SKILL.md` — deep content extraction via Work IQ
- Keyword-based search (stopword-filtered title tokens, max 8) instead of exact subject matching
- Link context: Teams Thread-ID and Outlook ItemID extracted from task links via regex
- Sender treated as hint, not filter — fixes false negatives from inaccurate metadata
- 3-attempt retry strategy: keywords → broader keywords → sender-based
- 180s timeout per task

### Phase 3: Update Check
- Detects new replies/messages since original task creation
- Appends updates to existing summary with `📌 Update:` prefix
- 90s timeout per task

### Schema Migration (v2 → v3)
- New fields: `enrichmentStatus`, `updateCheckStatus`, `enrichedAt`, `lastUpdateCheck`
- Automatic migration on server startup (`migrateToV3()`)

### Frontend
- Three-dot step indicators per task card (Discovery ● Enrichment ● Update)
- Freeze mode: neon cyan border (`#00d4ff`) + pulsing badge during agent work
- `refreshSingleTask()` — auto-updates individual cards without full page reload
- Detailed history entries with search keywords, source, duration, confidence
- Summary section visible by default (blue left-border, 6em height)
- Timestamps: "📥 Discovered" / "🔄 Last updated"
- All UI text in English

### Bug Fixes
- Phase 2 now enriches ALL pending tasks (was: only newly discovered)
- Phase 3 now checks ALL enriched tasks (was: excluded new tasks)
- Stuck status reset on startup (enriching→pending, checking→pending)
- `enrichmentStatus` and `updateCheckStatus` added to PATCH allowed fields

## v1.4 — February 25, 2026

**Two-Phase Agent for Work Logging**

- Analyze phase: Copilot SDK without Work IQ (~5-15s), extracts user intent
- Execute phase: Copilot SDK with Work IQ (~30-120s), searches and logs
- Interaction panel for task-specific agent conversations
- Execution tracing: `agentPlan` + `agentExecution` objects on tasks
- Server logging: timestamps, session duration, prompt size, raw response preview
- Timeout increased: 90s → 120s for Work IQ execution
- Analyze prompt rewritten: concrete action plan instead of paraphrasing

---

## v1.3 — February 25, 2026

**AI-Powered Deduplication**

- Context-aware scan prompt: sends existing tasks as dedup context
- Safety-net Jaccard similarity check as fallback
- `SCAN_SKILL.md` rewritten with 4-branch decision logic (new/update/skip)
- `LOG_WORK_SKILL.md` created for work logging agent instructions

---

## v1.2 — February 24, 2026

**Task History & Work Logging**

- `history[]` array on each task (typed entries: creation, status-change, scan-update, note, conversation)
- Auto-cleanup: removes tasks older than 30 days (status: done)
- AI work logging via Copilot SDK + Work IQ MCP
- Write queue for concurrent task file access
- Schema v2: `history[]`, `doneAt`, `agentPlan`, `agentExecution`

---

## v1.1 — February 24, 2026

**Server Status Detection & Launcher**

- `checkServerHealth()` with AbortController (3s timeout)
- Offline banner with startup instructions
- Auto-reconnect polling every 5s
- Status dot in header (12px, green/red) with architecture tooltip
- Scan/Add buttons disabled when offline
- `START-DAILY-BRIEFING.bat` — port check, minimized server window, auto-browser
